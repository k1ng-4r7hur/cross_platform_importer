Chef has N subordinates. In order to complete a very important order he will choose exactly K of them. He can't choose less than K since it will be not enough to complete the order in time. On the other hand if he chooses more than K subordinates he can't control them during the operation. Help him to find the number of ways he can choose the team to complete this very important order.

ans.
var N, K, a, b, c,  j, i, x : qword;
    t : LongInt;

Function nzd(x, y : qword): qword;
Begin
  if y = 0
    then nzd := x
    else nzd := nzd(y, x mod y);
end;

begin
  Readln(t);
  For t := 1 to t do
  begin
    readln(n,k);
    if k > n   then begin writeln(0); continue; end;
    if k > n-k then k := n-k;

    c := 1;
    i := 1;
    while i <= k do
    begin
      a := nzd(c, i);
      c := c div a;
      j := i div a;
      b := nzd(n-i+1, j);
      j := j div b;
      b := (n-i+1) div b;
//      x := i div j;
      c := c * b div j;
      inc(i);
    end;

    writeln(c);
  end;
end.
